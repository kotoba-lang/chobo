;; bin/lint.cljs -- clj-kondo, without a JVM.
;;
;; ## What this replaces
;;
;; This repository used to lint through a deps.edn alias:
;;
;;   :lint {:replace-deps {clj-kondo/clj-kondo {:mvn/version "2024.11.14"}}
;;          :main-opts ["-m" "clj-kondo.main" "--lint" "src" "test"
;;                      "--fail-level" "error"]}
;;
;; run as `clojure -M:lint`. clj-kondo is not a JVM library here -- it is a
;; tool, and it ships a GraalVM native image for every platform this
;; workspace runs on. The alias was a delivery mechanism, not a dependency.
;; CLAUDE.md fixes the runtime order with the JVM demoted to last resort;
;; `scripts/verify-jvm-dependency-surface.cljs` classifies this alias as
;; `:jvm-lint` and calls it "the cheapest exit in the whole set".
;;
;; The lint itself is unchanged: same tool, same VERSION, same paths, same
;; --fail-level, therefore the same findings. Verified before landing by
;; running `clojure -M:lint` and this script on the same tree and diffing
;; the finding lines.
;;
;; ## Why not the npm package
;;
;; `npm install clj-kondo` looks like the obvious answer and is not one.
;; That package (a third-party republish, filipesilva/clj-kondo) declares
;; native URLs for darwin-x64, linux-x64 and win32-x64 ONLY. On Apple
;; Silicon -- every machine in this fleet -- binwrap finds no binary for the
;; platform, falls into its fallback branch, downloads
;; `clj-kondo-<v>-standalone.jar`, and `bin/clj-kondo` runs `java -jar`.
;;
;; It produces IDENTICAL findings and exits 0, so nothing in the output says
;; a JVM ran. Measured 2026-09-07 with `java` replaced by a stub that exits
;; 127: the native binary linted clean, the npm package printed
;; `JVM ESCAPE: java -jar .../clj-kondo.jar`. Converting to npm would have
;; moved the JVM from `clojure` to `java` and reported success.
;;
;; ## Why not `npx --yes clj-kondo@... --lint ...`
;;
;; Measured on this machine the same day: `npx --yes clj-kondo@2025.10.23
;; --version` prints `10.2.2` -- npx's own version -- and exits 0. npx
;; consumes the leading `--flag` as its own. CLAUDE.md already records this
;; breakage. A lint that never ran and exited 0 is the failure mode this
;; whole exercise is about.
;;
;; ## How the binary is obtained
;;
;; In order: $CLJ_KONDO, then `node_modules/.bin/clj-kondo`, then PATH, then
;; a shared per-user cache under $XDG_CACHE_HOME (or ~/.cache). If the cache
;; is empty the pinned release archive is downloaded from the clj-kondo
;; GitHub release and its SHA-256 checked against the digest published by
;; upstream alongside it (`<asset>.zip.sha256`) before anything is unpacked
;; or executed. The cache is keyed by version, so all repositories in this
;; workspace share ONE copy rather than one node_modules each.
;;
;; ## What it does when it cannot answer
;;
;; It exits 97 and prints REFUSED. It does not exit 0. "I could not lint"
;; and "I linted and it was clean" must not be the same value -- CLAUDE.md
;; ADR-2608136000. 97 rather than 2 because clj-kondo already uses 0/2/3 for
;; clean/warnings/errors and 1 for its own internal failure.
